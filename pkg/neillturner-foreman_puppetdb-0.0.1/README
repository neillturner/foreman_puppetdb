foreman_puppetdb
----------------
This is the foreman_puppetdb module. This is a complex and brittle install of Foreman, Puppet, and Puppetdb.

This is very centos/redhat specific and a very much a first version. 

The idea is to quickly bring up a foreman, puppet, puppetdb configured to use stored configs on one server, puppetmaster.example.com, suitable for production use. 

It uses apache and passenger instead of the internal puppet webbrick webserver as this scales better for production.
Configurations are stored in puppetdb so that dynamic configuration of Nagios can be done.   

The module assumes you have:
1. Installed puppet version 3: 
 rpm -ivh http://yum.puppetlabs.com/el/6/products/x86_64/puppetlabs-release-6-7.noarch.rpm
 yum install puppet
2. Set Security Enhanced Linux to disabled.
3 Installed httpd 
   yum install httpd  

Use puppet apply to install the module.

1. Installs various pre-requisities. 
2. Installs Foreman, postgresql, puppetmaster, and passenger using the foreman install 
   as per Foreman quickstart http://theforeman.org/manuals/1.3/quickstart_guide.html.  
3. Install passenger and configures it to run puppet under the apache httpd server.
4. Installs puppetdb to run under postgresql. 
5. Finally need to test 
    a. On a client 
              yum install puppet
               puppet agent -t --server=puppetmaster.example.com  --environment=production --logdest /var/log/puppet/agent.log -v -d 
    b. Sign Certificate
              Go to Foreman https://puppetmaster.example.com logon as admin pw change me. 
    	      Go to More > Configuration > Smart Proxies	 and click certificates for puppetmaster-example-com
 		     Click sign for client.
    c. Back on client run again at it will work
             puppet agent -t --server=puppetmaster.example.com  --environment=production --logdest /var/log/puppet/agent.log -v -d   
			 

RERUNNING
---------			 
 Unfortunatelty the foreman-installer does not seem to be idempotent so to rerun the install			 
      1. On the puppermaster.example.com first to run the /root/clean.sh script to create a clean server to re-install. 
      2. On the test client run the following to clean and reinstall puppet: 
	         yum remove puppet
             rm -rf /etc/puppet  			 
			 rm -rf /var/lib/puppet  (so the SSL certificate will be recreated).
             yum install puppet 

DEBUGGING
--------- 			 
1. The Puppetdb can be accesses via: 
   psql -h puppetmaster.example.com -U puppetdb -W puppetdb
   password: puppetdb 
2. You can check the configurations via: 
    puppet agent --server=puppetmaster.example.com  --environment=production --configprint all| egrep "dbadapter|storeconfig"
